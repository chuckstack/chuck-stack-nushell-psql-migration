# Implementation Roadmap

## Overview
This roadmap breaks down the nushell psql migration utility implementation into manageable milestones, each building on the previous phase.

## Milestone 1: Foundation (MVP)
**Goal**: Basic single-track migration execution with psql integration

### 1.1 Project Structure
- [ ] Create basic nushell module structure

- [ ] Establish utility modules (`utils/` directory)

### 1.2 Configuration System
- [ ] Implement environment variable handling
- [ ] Create configuration loading from JSON
- [ ] Add validation for required PostgreSQL connection variables
- [ ] Test connection establishment with psql

### 1.3 Migration Discovery
- [ ] Implement file scanning for `.sql` files in directory
- [ ] Parse migration filenames (timestamp, track, description)
- [ ] Validate filename format and structure
- [ ] Sort migrations by timestamp

### 1.4 Basic Migration Execution
- [ ] Create metadata table for single track
- [ ] Check which migrations have been applied
- [ ] Execute pending migrations via psql
- [ ] Record successful migrations in metadata table
- [ ] Implement basic error handling and rollback

### 1.5 Core Commands (Phase 1)
- [ ] `migrate status ./path` - Show applied vs pending migrations
- [ ] `migrate run ./path` - Execute pending migrations
- [ ] `migrate history ./path` - Show migration history

### Milestone 1 Definition of Done
- Single track migrations work end-to-end
- Basic error handling and transaction rollback
- Core commands functional for single directory
- Configuration via environment variables

## Milestone 2: Multi-Track Support
**Goal**: Support multiple migration tracks with path-based execution

### 2.1 Multi-Track Architecture
- [ ] Extract track name from filename
- [ ] Create track-specific metadata tables
- [ ] Implement track discovery from directory paths
- [ ] Support track-specific migration execution

### 2.2 Enhanced Directory Handling
- [ ] Support subdirectory scanning
- [ ] Implement one-track-per-directory validation
- [ ] Add mixed directory support as fallback
- [ ] Create directory structure validation

### 2.3 Cross-Track Operations
- [ ] Implement execution order (core first, then others alphabetically)
- [ ] Support running all tracks in directory tree
- [ ] Add track filtering capabilities
- [ ] Create track status reporting

### 2.4 Enhanced Commands
- [ ] Update all commands to support multi-track scenarios
- [ ] Add track-specific status reporting
- [ ] Implement tree-wide migration execution
- [ ] Add validation for track consistency

### Milestone 2 Definition of Done
- Multiple tracks work independently
- Core-first execution order implemented
- Directory tree operations functional
- All commands support multi-track scenarios

## Milestone 3: Pre-flight Validation
**Goal**: Add nushell script validation before SQL execution

### 3.1 Nushell Script Integration
- [ ] Detect `.nu` files alongside `.sql` files
- [ ] Execute `.nu` files before SQL execution
- [ ] Implement error propagation from validation scripts
- [ ] Add validation script output handling

### 3.2 Validation Framework
- [ ] Create validation utilities for common checks
- [ ] Implement database state checking helpers
- [ ] Add cross-track dependency validation
- [ ] Create validation result reporting

### 3.3 Atomic Execution with Validation
- [ ] Integrate pre-flight validation into execution flow
- [ ] Ensure validation errors prevent SQL execution
- [ ] Maintain transaction atomicity after validation
- [ ] Add validation timing and logging

### 3.4 Migration Creation with Validation
- [ ] Add `--with-validation` flag to `migrate add`
- [ ] Create validation script templates
- [ ] Implement validation script generation
- [ ] Add validation best practices documentation

### Milestone 3 Definition of Done
- Pre-flight validation prevents invalid migrations
- Validation scripts can check dependencies
- Atomic execution preserved with validation
- Migration creation supports validation scripts

## Milestone 4: Advanced psql Features
**Goal**: Leverage psql variables and conditional execution

### 4.1 Variable Injection
- [ ] Inject migration metadata as psql variables
- [ ] Add track name and timestamp variables
- [ ] Implement execution ID generation
- [ ] Create variable documentation and examples

### 4.2 psql Feature Examples
- [ ] Create example migrations using variables
- [ ] Demonstrate conditional migration patterns
- [ ] Add dynamic SQL generation examples
- [ ] Document psql feature integration

### 4.3 Enhanced Migration Templates
- [ ] Update migration creation to include variable examples
- [ ] Add conditional migration templates
- [ ] Create complex migration pattern examples
- [ ] Document best practices for psql features

### 4.4 Testing and Validation
- [ ] Test variable injection across different scenarios
- [ ] Validate conditional migration execution
- [ ] Test error handling with psql features
- [ ] Add integration tests for advanced features

### Milestone 4 Definition of Done
- Migration tool injects useful variables
- Example migrations demonstrate psql features
- Migration creation includes advanced templates
- Comprehensive testing of psql integration

## Implementation Notes

### Development Approach
- Each milestone should be fully functional before moving to the next
- Write tests for each component as it's implemented
- Maintain backward compatibility between milestones
- Document decisions and trade-offs in each phase

### Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for individual functions and modules
- Integration tests for full migration workflows
- End-to-end tests with real PostgreSQL databases
- Test with various PostgreSQL versions and configurations

### Risk Mitigation
- Start with simple, well-understood functionality
- Validate assumptions early with small test cases
- Plan for rollback and recovery at each milestone
- Document known limitations and workarounds

### Success Criteria
Each milestone should be evaluated on:
- Functional completeness of planned features
- Code quality and maintainability
- Test coverage and reliability
- Documentation completeness
- User experience and usability

## Getting Started
Begin with Milestone 1 by setting up the basic project structure and implementing the core configuration system. This foundation will support all subsequent features and provide early validation of the overall approach.
